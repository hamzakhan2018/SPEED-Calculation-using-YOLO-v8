### Speed Estimation using YOLOv8 and Ultralytics

This repository contains code for estimating the speed of vehicles in a video using YOLOv8 object detection model and Ultralytics library.

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to use YOLOv8 for object detection and Ultralytics for speed estimation in a video stream.
The code detects vehicles in a video, tracks them, and estimates their speed based on predefined regions of interest.


## Features

- Vehicle detection using YOLOv8.
- Vehicle tracking for speed estimation.
- Speed estimation based on predefined regions of interest.
- Output video with speed annotations.

## Installation
 - YOLO (Ultralytics)
 
 - OPEN CV
